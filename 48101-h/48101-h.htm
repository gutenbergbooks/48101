Scorpion in California</a></p>

<p class="caption2">M. L. MOLES</p>


<p>In April, 1916, Dr. W. A. Hilton collected some small whip-scorpions
in the Pomona College Park at Claremont. These creatures
were without eyes and yet they seemed to avoid forceps. They
were able to run backwards or forwards with equal ease. On
examination it was found that there were long hairs on the legs
such as shown in the figure. Other specimens were afterwards
found in one of the nearby canyons, and two specimens in the college
collection were marked &ldquo;C. Metz, in the mountains near Claremont.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon looking through the literature the species was determined
to be <i>Trithyreus pentapeltis</i> Cook. In 1899 Dr. Hubbard collected
some at Palm Springs under stones in the canyon near the
stream. Those which we have found this year were under the
dried oak leaves some distance from water. Cook gave the generic
name <i>Hubbardia</i> which has not been sustained.</p>

<p>The following are the measurements of two types of the twenty
or more specimens found.</p>

<p>
<i>Measurements</i>&mdash;supposed Male:<br />
<br />
Length of whole body, 7.5 mm.<br />
Length of cephalothorax, 2 mm.<br />
Length of abdomen, 3 mm.<br />
Length of tail, 2.5 mm.<br />
Length of first leg, 8 mm.<br />
Length of maxillæ, 1.5 mm.<br />
Width of abdomen, 1 mm.<br />
Width of cephalothorax, 8 mm.<br />
<br />
<i>Measurements</i>&mdash;Supposed Female and Juvenile, Fig. 1:<br />
<br />
Length of whole body, 4.5 mm.<br />
Length of cephalothorax, 1.5 mm.<br />
Length of abdomen, 2 mm.<br />
Length of tail, 1 mm.<br />
Length of first leg, 5.5 mm.<br />
Length of maxillæ, 2 mm.<br />
Width of cephalothorax, 6 mm.<br />
Width of abdomen, 1 mm.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>Color of supposed Male</i>&mdash;Cephalothorax and maxillæ, dark reddish
brown. Abdomen and legs light yellow brown.</p>

<p><i>Color of supposed Female and Juvenile</i>&mdash;All parts bright yellow
brown.</p>

<p>Cephalothorax suboval, upper margin strongly concave at the
sides and tapering to a point at the median line. Sides convex at
upper edge; lower margin strongly convex. The cephalothorax is
strongly chitinized, showing two small oval spots. The small
suboval area between the chitinized cephalothorax and the abdomen
is soft with five chitinized plates.</p>

<p>On the dorsal surface of each abdominal segment are two muscle
depressions, while on the ventral surface the fourth, fifth and sixth
segments have dark colored plates near the segmental divisions
which are used for muscle attachments; besides the two muscle
depressions.</p>

<p>The book-lungs openings are found on the ventral surface of the
first abdominal segment, as is also the epigynum.</p>

<p>The caudal appendage of the juvenile and female is made up of
three small joints tapering to a blunt end. It is held in an upright
position above the abdomen. Cook in his description supposed
this form to be a female or juvenile; Krayselin considers it a different
species, but upon close study of the rest of the organs of
this form it was finally decided that it was a juvenile and probably
a female, the supposition being held that the juvenile took the form
of the female, as is often the case, until the last few molts. The
epigynum of this form was extremely undeveloped, having only a
small epigastric furrow with depressions at either end.</p>

<p>The caudal appendage of the supposed male is made up of two
stout joints to which is attached a heart-shaped body tapering to a
blunt apex. This body has deep pits both on the dorsal and ventral
sides near the base.</p>

<p>On the tibia of the first pair of legs are two long special sensory
hairs set in little pits. On the second, third and fourth legs one
hair was found, also on the tibia. These hairs are three-fourths
as long as the leg.</p>

<p>The mouth parts consist of a pair of strong mandibles and labium.
The labium is placed between the two coxæ of the maxillæ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
The long process of the coxa clothed with its long simple hairs
seems to have some performance in the work of the mouth parts.
The labium is suboval, clothed thickly with simple short hairs, the
upper margin having a single row of long heavy straight hairs
with many long single curved hairs covering them.</p>

<p>The mandibles are provided with three distinct kinds of hairs
or spines. The large subquadrate proximal joint was clothed with
long barbed spines, the movable finger having on its median surface
a row of fifteen back curved barbed spines. In the space
between the movable and stationary finger were long hairs, enlarged
in the center and tapering off to a fine point, the tapered
portion being barbed. The mandibles are set well down in the
sephalothorax.</p>

<p>The sexual openings were found in the usual place; the ventral
surface of the first abdominal segment, this being enlarged so as
to do away with the second abdominal segment. The epigynum
consists of a long epigastric furrow with a large lip-like opening
near its median line. Just above this opening and on either side
were small longitudinal creases.</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Friedrich Dahl places the external sexual organs of
this family on the legs and in the Thelyphonidæ which is closely
related. They are found in the second joint of the tarsus of the
first legs. Careful study failed to find any trace of secondary sexual
organs in <i>Trithyreus pentapeltis</i>.</p>

<p class="caption3">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>From a careful perusal of the literature it is apparent that scarcely
anything but the original description of <i>Haltica probata</i> Fall appears
in print. As this species has at various times been reported on several
of our cultivated plants, and as there is some possibility of its
becoming destructive to our cultivated roses, observations have been
made from time to time and this paper brings together, so far as
possible, the recorded facts concerning the species.</p>


<p class="caption3">HISTORY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES</p>

<p>The species was first described by Dr. H. C. Fall in 1910.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Mr.
Arthur Gibson<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> mentions it as attacking leaves of strawberry plants
at Nelson, British Columbia. The species is referred to as <i>Haltica
evicta</i> Lec., but after a comparison with specimens in the writer&rsquo;s
collection and later in Dr. Fall&rsquo;s collection at Pasadena, California,
I am led to believe that the species reported by Mr. Gibson as
<i>evicta</i> is not <i>evicta</i> but <i>probata</i>. It has been reported from Spokane,
Washington, on strawberries, and at various times has been reported
feeding on cultivated crops in Oregon.</p>

<p>The species is distributed along the Pacific Coast from British
Columbia to California. It has been reported from Nelson in
British Columbia; Everett and Spokane in Washington; from Corvallis,
Pamelia Lake, Mary&rsquo;s Peak, the Three Sisters, and Josephine
County in Oregon; and from Santa Rosa, Belmont, Siskiyou, and
Trinity Counties in California.</p>

<p class="caption3">SEASONAL LIFE-HISTORY AND HABITS OF THE
SPECIES</p>

<p>With the approach of warm weather in the spring, when the
buds of the wild rose are showing their green, the little bronze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
beetles (<a href="#Figure_2">Pl. I, Fig. 2</a>) come from their winter quarters, about the
middle of April or earlier depending on the spring weather conditions,
and commence feeding on the tender small leaves of the
expanding buds. The beetles possess a very brilliant lustre and
when approached manifest a saltatorial habit, and may leap for a
considerable distance. The insect passes the winter in the adult
stage and during that time may be found concealed in convenient
places. The writer has taken numerous individuals from beneath
the moss of the scrub oak, which grows abundantly along the creeks
in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The first individuals were
taken on April 11, 1913, feeding on a species of wild rose, <i>Rosa
nukatana</i> Presl. near Corvallis, Oregon. The adults were at the
time resting in the sun on the dried fruits of the rose and also on
the moss which covered the oaks. In 1915, the first beetles were
out on March 19 or somewhat earlier. Sometimes the March
weather is too severe so that the beetles do not appear until later,
and the inclement weather frequently puts a stop to the activity of
the beetles and retards oviposition.</p>

<p>After emerging from their hibernating quarters, the beetles jump
or fly to the nearest rose bush and soon begin to satisfy their appetite
after the long winter&rsquo;s fast. At this time the tender bursting
rose buds seem to be the favorite food, and the beetles engorge
themselves with bites from the prospective crop of leaves, then
locked up in the buds. The beetles seem to be most active during
the warmer sunshiny portions of the day, when they may be seen
jumping and flying about the rose bushes. When touched or jarred,
they at once drop quickly to the ground, where they feign death for
a short time, later returning to the foliage. Their shining bronze
color renders it easy to discover and watch them at their destructive
work. They begin gnawing an unsightly hole into either the side or
top of the bursting leaf bud, often boring into the bud so far as
to be almost hidden from view. It usually takes the beetles a few
days to satisfy their vigorous spring appetites; then they turn their
attention to the propagation of their kind. The later emerging
adults feed voraciously on the foliage (<a href="#Figure_5">Pl. I, Fig. 5</a>) eating out
irregular places in the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p>

<p>Many individuals were found in copulo on April 12, 1913, and
on April 14, 1915. Eggs were laid in great numbers April 15,
1913, but not until the first of May in 1915, due to a long stretch of
cold wet weather. By May 18 many eggs were to be found but
usually no larvae. The eggs are laid in masses (<a href="#Figure_3">Pl. I, Fig. 3</a>) of
from two to fifteen in a cluster with an average of between seven
and nine. They are deposited usually on the lower surface of the
leaf. No eggs are deposited until the foliage is well along usually,
as this is the food of the larvae. The writer observed a female
during oviposition. She thrusts out the egg and by a mucilagenous
substance causes the egg to adhere fast to the leaf. She decorates
the egg, as it were, with a fluid which later turns black and appears
as a streak across the ova. The adults do not live long after egg
deposition, usually about a week and a half. A number of females
were observed to lay from forty to fifty eggs each.</p>

<p>The length of the egg stage was found to vary considerably even
in the insectary, due no doubt largely to the weather conditions.
In indoor observations it ranged from seven to fifteen days, with
an average of twelve. In the open, eggs under screen cloth were
deposited on May 24, 1913, and hatched June 10, 1913, a duration
of seventeen days. By June, 1913, practically all of the egg masses
had hatched and scarcely an adult could be found anywhere. The
larvae are at first yellow, changing over to a black after a short
period of time (<a href="#Figure_7">Pl. I, Fig. 7</a>). The eggs split at the side when
the young emerge and the larvae remain quiet for some time apparently
feeding first on the remaining egg juices. After a while they
begin to move about for convenient feeding spots. The larvae
moult three times, and after each moulting appear yellow, soon
changing to a black. Several of the grubs usually work on the same
leaf, continuing to eat small irregular holes, through, or nearly
through, the leaf until it appears skeletonized (<a href="#Figure_7">Pl. I, Fig. 7</a>), when
they seek new pastures.</p>

<p>When full grown the larvae drop to the soil and after burrowing
to a depth of about an inch or less, they construct soil cells of earth
(<a href="#Figure_6">Pl. I, Fig. 6</a>), not unlike the cell of the common cherry and pear
slug, in which they pupate. By July 3, 1913, many larvae were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
falling to the soil. The length of the larval stage varies from fifteen
to twenty-five days with an average of twenty days. By July 10
many pupae (<a href="#Figure_4">Pl. I, Fig. 4</a>) were found in the soil. The writer
neglected to ascertain the exact length of the pupal stage, but from
the meager observations made up to this time ventures the opinion
that it is about eighteen days. By the first of August many adults
could be found. They are a beautiful metallic color when just
emerged. The writer bred from the adults a species of Diptera a
<i>Tachinid</i> but has not been able to ascertain the species. Subsequent
observation revealed no eggs, so undoubtedly the species is single
brooded. The life-cycle is calculated to last about fifty-five days
from eggs to adults, but this is greatly influenced by the weather
conditions. The length of the adult stage is about ten months,
depending, of course, upon the time the warm days approach in
the spring and upon the cold stretches which intervene, conditions
which influence emergence from their hibernating quarters.</p>


<p class="caption3">DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS STAGES</p>

<p>The Eggs (<a href="#Figure_3">Pl. I, Fig. 3</a>) are of an orange color, oblong oval or
bean-shaped. The egg has a delicate covering by which it is
attached to the leaf. Nearly every egg has a sort of spine-shape
structure attached, although it is not exactly a spine but a part of
the egg covering, which, when it has dried, gives it a black streaked
appearance at that point. The egg measures 1 mm. in length by
.25 mm. in width.</p>

<p>The Larvae (<a href="#Figure_7">Pl. I, Fig. 7</a>) when full grown have the body wider
at the anterior end, tapering gradually to the anal segment and
covered with many hairs. They are covered with an oily substance
in which they often collect their excrement as they feed and travel.
The entire larva is black and the segments of the body possess
numerous tubercles bearing setae. Each segment of the abdomen
has a group of tubercles on a side above the spiracles. When full
grown the larvae measure from 6 to 8 mm. in length.</p>

<p>The Pupa (<a href="#Figure_4">Pl. I, Fig. 4</a>) is yellow, 4 to 6 mm. in length, with
the wing pads and legs of a paler yellow to nearly white. Two
setae are located on the vertex and two on the occupit of head. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax bear spines varying in
number. The abdomen possesses three rows of setae on each side
above the spiracles.</p>

<p>The Adult (<a href="#Figure_1">Pl. I, Fig. 1</a>) is green bronze, entire upper surface
polished and strongly shining sculpture throughout, nearly as in
<i>Haltica ignita</i>. Antennæ piceous, slightly more than half the
length of the body, joints 2-3-4 gradually increasing in length, the
fourth very nearly three times as long as wide. Eyes rather small
and not very prominent, their width as seen from the front distinctly
less than half the interocular distance. Prothorax two-thirds
wider than long, sides parallel in basal half, convergent anteriorly.
Elytra fully two-thirds as wide as long, and nearly three-fourths
wider than the prothorax. Body beneath piceous; abdomen alutaceous,
rather coarsely punctate and transversely rugulose. Length
3.7 mm. to 4 mm.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="Notes_on_Birds_of_Laguna_Beach_and" id="Notes_on_Birds_of_Laguna_Beach_and">Notes on Birds of Laguna Beach and
Vicinity for 1916</a></p>

<p class="caption2">H. H. NININGER</p>


<p>In addition to the work done by Mr. Leon Gardener and others
on the distribution of birds in the vicinity of Laguna Beach I noted
the following species in the summer of 1916:</p>


<p class="caption3">70. <i>Sturna hirundo</i> (Common Tern)</p>

<p>This species was found occasionally about the muddy flats at
Balboa.</p>


<p class="caption3">74. <i>Sturna antillarum</i> (Least Tern)</p>

<p>The Least Tern is much more common than the former. They
were often seen in small flocks diving for fish along the coast from
Laguna to Balboa. They probably nest along the sandy shores;
but none of their nests were taken by the writer.</p>


<p class="caption3">95. <i>Puffinis griseus</i> (Dark Bodied Shearwater)</p>

<p>These birds were found ten to twelve miles from shore, in flocks
feeding over schools of fish. They are called by the fishermen
&ldquo;Barracuda Birds.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption3">210. <i>Rollus obsoletus</i> (Calif. Clapper Rail)</p>

<p>Found in the swampy tracts about Balboa.</p>


<p class="caption3">214. <i>Porzana carolina</i> (Sora Rail)</p>

<p>A specimen of this Rail was taken at one of the lakes in Laguna
Canyon in the latter part of July.</p>


<p class="caption3">421. <i>Chordeiles acutipennis</i> (Texas Night Hawk)</p>

<p>Either at dusk or at dawn these birds could be found abundantly,
in certain localities, feeding over fields, pools and streams to which
they came at dusk, from the hills where they spent the daylight
hours. Mr. C. C. White found a pair of young almost ready for
flight on one of the hills bordering on Laguna Canyon, July 7, 1916.</p>


<p class="caption3">425. <i>Aeronautes melanoleucus</i> (White-throated Swift)</p>

<p>Mr. Charles A. Keeler in &ldquo;Bird Notes Afield&rdquo; (1889) records
this species from Capistrano. To one accustomed to meeting with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
this bird only among the high and almost inaccessible cliffs of the
mountains it is no little surprise to find it in a district so nearly level
as the region about this old mission settlement. But surely it is
there. A visit to the place in the latter part of July revealed the
fact that they are, seventeen years since Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s writings, still
using the same broken walls as a retreat. I think they are nesting at
the time we visited the place, for upon the entrance of an adult into
one of the crevices there came cries of young birds which seemed to
be coming from birds that were being fed.</p>


<p class="caption3">530a. <i>Astragalinus P. hesperophilus</i> (Green-backed Goldfinch)</p>

<p>Common around Laguna and the neighboring hills. Nests with
eggs were found, probably the second brood for the season.</p>


<p class="caption3">634. <i>Vireo vicinior</i> (Gray Vireo)</p>

<p>Found along the streams near Capistrano.</p>


<p class="caption3">685a. <i>Wilsonia pusilla pileolata</i> (Pileolated Warbler)</p>

<p>Fairly common in trees along streams near Capistrano.</p>


<p class="caption3">364. <i>Pandion haliaetus carolinensis</i> (American Osprey)</p>

<p>One of these magnificent birds was found on the rocky cliffs bordering
the shore between Laguna and Balboa. It was seen several
times and was reasonably tame.</p>


<p class="caption3">BREEDING NOTES</p>

<p>In addition to the nests of the more common birds the following
were noted:</p>

<p>Several Raven nests on the cliffs bordering the shore and are in
Boat Canyon about a mile from the sea were found deserted, but
feathers of their owners and the remains of their food betrayed
their identity.</p>

<p>A brood of Ruddy Ducks was seen on one of the lakes in Laguna
Canyon several times.</p>

<p>Coots were found breeding about the lakes in abundance.</p>

Sipunculid</a></p>

<p class="caption2">WILLIAM A. HILTON</p>


<p>A number of specimens of the genus Phascolosoma were obtained
at Laguna Beach. These were preserved in various fluids. Flemming&rsquo;s
fluid and mercuric chloride, were especially valuable for
study. The nerve cords were dissected out and mounted after staining.
Some were imbedded, sectioned and stained. The stain which
brought out the cells with greatest clearness was copper haematoxylin.</p>

<p>The general character of the nervous system of sipunculids is well
known, and the specimens examined at this time were typical as to
the form of the brain and cord. The brain is imbedded in the proboscis
just below the tentacles. It has a similar appearance in
section to the photographs of Spengel, 1912. The brain is small.
Two main branches supply nearby tentacles and muscles. There
is a pair of small branches from the connectives. Extending from
the epithelium of the tentacular region is a pair of tubes leading
into the brain, the cerebral organs. These epithelial tubes lead
to a pigmented area on each side, and these pigmented areas in
section look like simple eyes. A few irregular spots of pigment
were found near the larger masses. The epithelium at the outer
end of the tube was also deeply pigmented.</p>

<p>Throughout the body the ventral nerve cord kept about the same
width, although the muscle bands at the sides increased somewhat.
The strands connecting the muscles and nerves to the animal&rsquo;s body
were more or less regularly arranged. In specimens with the proboscis
drawn in, the nerve cord is of course doubled back on itself.
In the specimen drawn at the junction of the two parts, that of the
proboscis and that of the ventral body-wall, there is a lack of lateral
branches, as shown in the upper portion of the second line of the
drawing. Towards the caudal end the lateral branches come off
more irregularly.</p>

<p>When the animal is contracted the nerve cord seems to be segmented,
but sections show that this appearance is due to the slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
folding of the nerve cord within the muscle bands; the nerve tissue
does not seem to be elastic.</p>

<p>Very little has been written on the histological structure of
sipunculids. Haller, 1889, discusses a number of points, especially
in <i>sipunculus nudus</i>, relating to the ventral cord only. I find a number
of differences in this form. I did not find any very clear evidence
of special neuroglia cells, such as described and figured by Haller,
such elements may be present, but at least they are not evident,
not so evident as in many other invertebrates which I have examined.
Nerve cells may anastomose with each other as shown in
Haller&rsquo;s figure, but of this I can not be sure. If fibres do not unite
they are in very intimate contact.</p>

<p>In the ventral cord no small fibrils were seen only rather small
fibers which may have been fibrils. The lack of connective material
in part at least, perhaps because the nervous system is often extended
and folded, shows the cell processes with great distinctness. This
may be why a clearer picture than usual is presented of the relationship
of cells.</p>

<p>Cells are abundant on the ventral side of the cord, especially in
the middle line. The more dorsal fibrous region is practically without
cells of any kind. No very marked tracts of fibers are evident,
the fibers are about equally distributed in all directions and may be
subdivided as follows:</p>

<p>1. Fibers which enter the fibrous mass from cells and run short
distances up and down.</p>

<p>2. Fibers which pass from cells to other cells near by in the
cellular area.</p>

<p>3. Fibers which leave the ganglion laterally from ventral cells.</p>

<p>4. Fibers which enter from the lateral nerves to end in the fiber
area or in among the cells.</p>

<p>There are no indications of long fibers, either ascending or
descending. After the examination of the cord of this animal one
is impressed with the suggestion that many cells of similar sort act
alike, that is groups of cells, not individuals are involved in the
simplest transmissions of impulses. This general suggestion which,
of course, is not new, comes to mind with great clearness after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
study of thin sections of the cord of this animal. Whether the cells
actually anastomose or not is a question hard to decide, but in
the numerous contacts of naked fibers there is, I believe, ample
opportunity for the transmission of complex changes from cell to
cell, to all parts of the nervous system. In this form there is no
particular localization of definite centers.</p>

<p>The brain differs in structure from the cord, the central fibrous
mass is more dense, the cells are very much smaller and more
numerous. Some cells of the brain send their fibers out directly
without the common pathway of a distinct nerve trunk. No special
features of the brain were determined except the cerebral organs
already described.</p>

Laguna Beach</a></p>


<p>The specimens reported upon are from a collection made by P. A.
Lichti during the summer of 1915, and from a small collection
brought in during the summer of 1916. The determinations of all
but the fifth were kindly made by Prof. W. E. Ritter.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Ascidia californica</i> Ritter and Forsythe</p>

<p>These simple forms were found quite abundantly under stones
and in kelp holdfasts. The form of the body was determined largely
by the position the animal took on the stone or seaweed.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Styela barnharti</i> Ritter and Forsythe</p>

<p>The specimens obtained were young, simple, of a redish-brown
color and about 4 mm. high. They were found under stones at
low tide but not as commonly as some others.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Styla montereyensis</i> Dall</p>

<p>A single specimen of this large, simple species was taken just off
shore. It was slender at the base, expanded near the openings and
of a redish-brown color.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Euherdmania claviformis</i> Ritter</p>

<p>This slender species was often found in clusters under stones.
They were about 2 mm. in diameter and 10-20 mm. long, sometimes
free from sand, at other times covered with sand grains.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Goodsiria dura</i> Ritter</p>

<p>Bright red or orange masses of these were often found in bits of
seaweed from deeper water. The individuals were 2 to 3 mm.
across and often closely massed on the seaweed or other support.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Eudistoma diaphones</i> Ritter and Forsythe</p>

<p>This was the common compound species found closely attached to
the lower sides of stones. It was often quite extensive but not thick
or colored.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Eudistoma psamion</i> Ritter and Forsythe</p>

<p>Great masses of this tough, pinkish or slightly colored form
were found under rock ledges. It resembles one of the sponges in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
general appearance and is found in among sponges and polyzoans.
This was one of the most bulky forms which we found.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Glossophorum planum</i> Ritter and Forsythe</p>

<p>Irregular masses of this species were found under rock ledges and
under stones. Our specimens are largely covered with sand grains.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>Distaplia occidentalis</i> Ritter and Forsythe</p>

<p>This compound stalked form was found on a rock ledge at low
tide near Salt Creek.</p>

<p>The summer school at Laguna Beach during the past season was
in many respects the most valuable of the past five or six years.
There were more students, more teachers and fully as many visitors.
The harvest of specimens was very satisfactory. Many creatures
not before gathered here were brought from the nearby waters.
Amphioxus was obtained here for the first time, as well as many
other interesting and valuable specimens.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 518px;">
<img src="images/pg38.png" width="518" height="331" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Several new courses were offered. A course in Ecology was
given by Professor Bean. In this the local distribution of animals
was especially studied. A similar course is to be offered this summer
to those who have had some zoology. It is believed that this
work will bring greater and greater advantages to us here as we
come to know the local conditions better. In the nature of the
material this will always be to a large extent a field study.</p>

<p>The course in birds given by Professor Nininger was interesting
and valuable. A number of new records for this region were
obtained during the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 514px;">
<img src="images/pg39a.png" width="514" height="329" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the first time Miss Hills gave a course in drawing in connection
with zoological subjects. This much-needed and valuable
work will be continued during the coming summer, not only in a
special course, but also in an optional way in connection with several
of the other courses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with the ecology especially, more off-shore collecting
was done than ever before. A number of longer trips were found
interesting and valuable. Laguna at all times offers attractive walks
and many short trips were taken by all classes. Some of these were
for a few miles along the coast, back in the hills or by water or land
for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>The rocks and coves were again explored, yet much remains
unknown. Many new specimens to the locality were found, some of
these were from deeper water, rare fish, large sea cucumbers, a
large number of strange crabs and many other smaller but no less
interesting creatures.</p>

<p>As in the past, a number of workers from other institutions used
the private laboratories. The eight research rooms were in use
most of the time by those doing more advanced work. It is expected
that there will be a number of advanced workers from the northern
and eastern universities during the coming season. For the first
time the laboratory is provided with a satisfactory lighting system.
Electricity is now established at Laguna Beach and the laboratory
and tent city are well provided with an ample lighting system.</p>

<p>The tent city and dining hall will again offer accommodations
at reasonable prices. The cost of tuition is $7.50 general charge
and $3.00 an hour per hour taken. By an hour is meant the equivalent
of an hour&rsquo;s work in a regular college semester. There are
eight private rooms for special investigators.</p>

June 26 to September 20.)</p>

<p>Located in one of the most healthful and beautiful parts of the
west coast. The mountains reach an elevation of ten thousand feet
within a few miles of the college and these with the nearby ocean
afford many special advantages for the study of things not in books.
Special advantages are afforded by the fact that the college limits
its attendance, the freshman class being restricted to two hundred
applicants. The success of the college is particularly indicated by
the large proportion of the graduates who proceed to advanced
work in the large universities. In addition, well-manned departments
of music and art afford exceptional advantages.</p>
